# CarPaint

The other day I was asked about how to extract the Car from the Unity Standard Assets. I thought I'd share also the textures that I quickly created to give the Car some color. Instructions about how to load and assign the materials are in the readme.txt. The Unity Standard Assets license doesn't allow to share the assets on github, so this manual step is required.

To make this short, here's the default grey look.
